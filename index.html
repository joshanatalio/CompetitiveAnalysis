			<th>Brand:</th>
			<td><div><span>Fun </span>- The giant background image of young guys who appear to be designers in a "non-professional environment" (airport runway) convey the idea that their work isn't always strict or serious. <br>
				<span>Simple</span> - Studio Airport uses lots of basic icons and minimal text that gives the site a very simple feel. The home page has a minimal size, and there is no content beyond the break. Displaying only one image at a time gives the portfolio a feeling of cleanliness. <br>
				<span>Creative</span> - The company calls themselves "Creative Explorers", so it is obvious that the company wants to emphasize their unique ideas and thoughts. They also put their employees on an Airport Runway, which is humorous because the company is named Airport Studio.

			<tr>
				<th>Functionality:</th>
				<td><div>I would say that the design works for the message that the company is trying to convey because the main page opens with a very simple design. There is only one main body of text, and the focus of the page is the background picture and the shuffling images that change in the background. The content of the pictures gives the company an informal vibe, which I believe is what they are trying to communicate. </div></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Interactivity:</th>
				<td><div>The site has a decent amount of interactivity. The menu items can be hovered over and a description of where each item links to appears below the icon. The bottom left picture shows what happens when you click the "Projetcs" icon (where there are two rectangles laid over one another). This page has more interactivity and the user can rearrange the grid of project icons by using the sorting options on the left hand side. When they user clicks one of the categories, the projects shuffle and categorized themselves into their specified order. As you navigate the website, an animation of an hourglass appears on the bottom right corner of the screen to let the user know that their requested page is loading.</div></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Navigation:</th>
				<td><div>As you can see from all the screens above, the top menu bar stays consistent on all pages of the site. This makes navigation on the site fairly simple. To return to the home page of the site, you can click on the main logo of the of the company to return to the home page. This makes navigation easy and intuitive. The site doesn't have many pages, so you can see that all the information the company wants to share has been grouped into five main pages.</div></td>

				<th>Brand:</th>
				<td><div><span>Diverse</span> - Paul's portfolio has a lot of different types of work. The gallery layout of his work is displayed on his home page, and you can see the he wants to communicate the idea that his work is not bound to one style of art or one medium.<br>
					<span>Modern</span> -  The images on the gallery seem to be very new and up-to-date allowing him to establish himself as a freelancer who is aware of popular and current styles. <br>
					<span>Professional</span> - The portfolio is organized in a way that allows the user to see Paul's qualifications including his work, experience, awards, and client information. His gallery also includes a copy right logo next to his name, letting the user know that he means business. <br>
					<div>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Functionality:</th>
					<td><div> I think the design of his page does a great job of communicating his "brand" to all of his clients. His navigation bar includes items that potential customers would want to see, which clearly expresses that he has an adequate amount of freelance experience. His choice of a gallery allows him to show glimpses of many projects at one time, letting viewers know that he has worked on a large amount of different products. </div></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Interactivity:</th>
					<td> <div>The portfolio shows interactivity right of the start. The items of his gallery view are constantly shifting their images, in order to give a more diverse range of the project, and give a small description when you hover over them. You can also sort the gallery items by type if you click one of the categories at the top of the page. When one of them is clicked, the gallery adjusts itself in front of the user with a clean animation.</div> </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Navigation:</th>
					<td> <div>The navigation on the portfolio is primarily controlled by the menu bar on the left corner of the site. Each item links to a new page, all with different amounts of information. A user can get back to the "home" page of the website by either clicking on "Work" or by clicking on Paul's main logo, which is at the top of the navigation bar. The site lets you know where you are on the site by darkening the text of the navigation bar.</div> </td>
