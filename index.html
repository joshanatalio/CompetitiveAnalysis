			<th>Brand:</th>
			<td><div><span>Fun </span>- The giant background image of young guys who appear to be designers in a "non-professional environment" (airport runway) convey the idea that their work isn't always strict or serious. <br><br>
				<span>Simple</span> - Studio Airport uses lots of basic icons and minimal text that gives the site a very simple feel. The home page has a minimal size, and there is no content beyond the break. Displaying only one image at a time gives the portfolio a feeling of cleanliness. <br><br>
				<span>Creative</span> - The company calls themselves "Creative Explorers", so it is obvious that the company wants to emphasize their unique ideas and thoughts. They also put their employees on an Airport Runway, which is humorous because the company is named Airport Studio. 
			</div>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Functionality:</th>
		<td><div>I would say that the design works for the message that the company is trying to convey because the main page opens with a very simple design. There is only one main body of text, and the focus of the page is the background picture and the shuffling images that change in the background. The content of the pictures gives the company an informal vibe, which I believe is what they are trying to communicate. </div></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Interactivity:</th>
		<td><div>The site has a decent amount of interactivity. The menu items can be hovered over and a description of where each item links to appears below the icon. The bottom left picture shows what happens when you click the "Projetcs" icon (where there are two rectangles laid over one another). This page has more interactivity and the user can rearrange the grid of project icons by using the sorting options on the left hand side. When they user clicks one of the categories, the projects shuffle and categorized themselves into their specified order. As you navigate the website, an animation of an hourglass appears on the bottom right corner of the screen to let the user know that their requested page is loading.</div></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Navigation:</th>
		<td><div>As you can see from all the screens above, the top menu bar stays consistent on all pages of the site. This makes navigation on the site fairly simple. To return to the home page of the site, you can click on the main logo of the of the company to return to the home page. This makes navigation easy and intuitive. The site doesn't have many pages, so you can see that all the information the company wants to share has been grouped into five main pages.</div></td>

		<th>Brand:</th>
		<td><div><span>Diverse</span> - Paul's portfolio has a lot of different types of work. The gallery layout of his work is displayed on his home page, and you can see the he wants to communicate the idea that his work is not bound to one style of art or one medium.<br><br>
			<span>Modern</span> -  The images on the gallery seem to be very new and up-to-date allowing him to establish himself as a freelancer who is aware of popular and current styles. <br><br>
			<span>Professional</span> - The portfolio is organized in a way that allows the user to see Paul's qualifications including his work, experience, awards, and client information. His gallery also includes a copy right logo next to his name, letting the user know that he means business. <br>
		</div>
	</td>

	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td><div> I think the design of his page does a great job of communicating his "brand" to all of his clients. His navigation bar includes items that potential customers would want to see, which clearly expresses that he has an adequate amount of freelance experience. His choice of a gallery allows him to show glimpses of many projects at one time, letting viewers know that he has worked on a large amount of different products. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td> <div>The portfolio shows interactivity right of the start. The items of his gallery view are constantly shifting their images, in order to give a more diverse range of the project, and give a small description when you hover over them. You can also sort the gallery items by type if you click one of the categories at the top of the page. When one of them is clicked, the gallery adjusts itself in front of the user with a clean animation.</div> </td>

<tr>
	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td> <div>The navigation on the portfolio is primarily controlled by the menu bar on the left corner of the site. Each item links to a new page, all with different amounts of information.

<tr>
	<th>Brand:</th>
	<td><div><span>Green</span> - CID (Cast Iron Design Company) uses lots of environmentally "friendly" terms, like "Green" and "Environmentally Responsible", on their main page to ensure they can communicate to their audience that they are an environmentally friendly company.<br><br>
		<span>Vintage</span> - The main page of the portfolio gives off a very Western 1700's feel. From the font to the choice of pictures and coloring, it is obvious that CID's portfolio fits into American Frontier theme.<br><br>
		<span>Unique</span> - As a design company, they have chosen a unique theme by formatting their portfolio to the theme of the American Frontier. The pictures in their "About" section shows their founders wearing beaver skin hats. By choosing a historical theme and by emphasizing their values, they have branded themselves as a design company that is not like many others. 
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td> The site does a nice job of showing its theme right away. The first page a user sees, the top right photo, does a great job of expressing the company's theme and personality. The font, images, and text decorations used on the main page give off a Western 1700's feel, which could be interpreted as quirky from a modern point of view. On other pages of their site (e.g "About"), CID is able to give a direct explanation of their values and brand. Since the company is a design company, it is important that they are able to express their values in a visual manner</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td> CID's portfolio lacked interactivity. I noticed that hovering over the menu items caused the text to change color, but the effects were subtle and hard to notice. Another problem was that the site did not have a consistent menu bar at the top. This made the hover effects look better on some pages than others. One nice feature was that when looking at an individual product in their shop, you could hover over specific parts of the product and it would provide a zoomed in view of the specified area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td>The main source of navigation on this portfolio is on the top menu bar and the footer bar located at the bottom of the page (bottom right picture). The top bar provides directions to the main parts of the site. It lets you know where you are on the site by lightening the text of the navigation bar of whatever page you just clicked on. The main logo of the page serves as the "Home" button and will return you to the main page if you click on it. Overall, it is fairly simple to navigate the site, but not always easy to guess what type of information you are looking at on the front page. </td>

	<th>Brand:</th>
	<td><div><span>Fun</span> - Marc Thomas' portfolio gives off a very lively vibe. He uses lots of entertaining animations and his loading image is a bouncing cute and playful ghost character.<br><br>
		<span>Hip</span> - The portfolio seems gives off a very modern feel because of his use of animations and color scheme. He has lots of lively colors, and many people would describe this as a "cool" website.<br><br>
		<span>Artistic</span> - The choice to emphasize images on specific parts of the website (bottom left picture) show that the Marc wants to convey that his artwork is important and should be given a lot of attention to by viewers. 
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td>Based on using the site and the brands that are communicated, the site seems to be very functional. Page transitions and the consistency of the design help deliver the brands and makes sure the portfolio communicates Marc's ideas on all levels. By not including too much text, the portfolio is able to shift the user's attention to the artwork or projects depending on the page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td>The portfolio, overall, is very interactive. When the page loads, Marc's name animates onto the screen in a bubbly fashion. When transitioning to other pages, an animation appears on screen that signals the next page is loading and shows a cartoon ghost bouncing up and down. His navigation bar changes color on hover and his home page button also animates when hovered over. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td> Navigation on the site is nicely done. The primary navigator is the menu bar on the top of the page, and that stays consistent across all pages. In addition to this, the menu bar highlights the current page the user is on and will change whenever the user changes pages. Each page also has a good sized title to show exactly what information should be on the page.</td>

<tr>
	<th>Brand:</th>
	<td><div><span>Designer</span> - This portfolio right away makes it very obvious that it is the portfolio of a designer. Whether it is the use of the words "Designer" or "Front-End" in a very large up-front font, or the fact that his logo says "Design" right on it, it is very obvious that this man is a designer.<br><br>
		<span>Blogger</span> - The link to Mitchel's blog is in the main navigation bar, and his latest blog post is also in the footer of all his pages. He wants viewers to know that he has a blog and provides many paths to access it. <br><br>
		<span>Retro</span> - The color scheme and main image choice for the background give off a very retro vibe. He uses old-school colors from the 60's and his main background looks like the style from back in 2000. 
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td>The site is mediocre in regards to functionality. He really pushes the idea that he is a designer, but does not back that up with significant proof. He has a limited amount of information on his projects and he seems to be pushing his blog more than his work. Even though he is emphasizing his blog, he doesn't have very many posts on it, which can leave the user with doubts about his credibly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td>The portfolio does not have much interactivity. The main page has some loading animations when you scroll down t o specific sections, but they only happen once per page. The navigation bar also underlines items on hover. Other than that, the site lacks a decent amount of interactivity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td>The sites navigation is also mediocre. On his main page, he seems to have a lot of random information about things that aren't relevant to himself and the information seems to be scattered all over the place. His other pages ("About", "Portfolio", and "Contact") all show what you would expect. The navigation bar does show you which page you are on by highlighting which page you are on.</td>

	<th>Brand:</th>
	<td>
		<div><span>Independent</span> - Build Films shows itself as a very independent film making company. They include a lot of documentary style images that don't seem to be "set up" or "computer generated". The site represents the ideas of and "independent" film maker. <br><br>
			<span>Professional</span> - The portfolio also gives off a professional vibe letting viewers know that they can be hired for services or contacted for any reason. The website stays professional and strays away from any animations that would make them seem childish or immature.<br><br>
			<span>Cinematic</span> - Since this is a film company, they would obviously want to brand themselves as cinematic. They do this by including a "Films" tab on their menu bar and by making their main page background shuffle between film scenes from what appear to be their movies.
		</div>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td> Their site is reasonably functional, but their videos and images take a significant time to load because they are very large and are high quality. They portfolio does a good job of highlighting their brands, especially the cinematic quality of the company. The portfolio uses the fixed navigation bar to show users all the pages of the company no matter where they are on the site.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td>Most of the interactivity on the site lies on the main page with the background that constantly shifts from different changing scenes of the company's films. Another part of interactivity is on the menu bar, when you hover each item the item is highlighted in black and the text turns white. The scrolling on each page gives a parallax effect and makes the site a little more fluid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td>The fixed menu bar on the site allows for easy navigation of the site and allows the viewer to go to any page on the site no matter where they are. In addition to this, the menu bar also highlights the current page the user is on. Each page also has a header picture along with the name of the page at the top, so this also helps with navigation. </td>

		<span>Memorable</span> - As a photography company, Innographs does a good job of showing their old work as "photo albums" portraying the idea that they take memorable and worthwhile photos. 
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td> The functionality of the site fits very well with the websites theme. They put a lot of emphasis on images and this helps express their brand as a photography company. The large images and minimal amount of text allow viewers to fully take in the photos without having to worry about reading too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td> Innographs has a decent amount if interactivity and uses shuffling images on their main page to showcase large and colorful pictures. Their navigation bar underlines text when you hover over each item and it also becomes a fixed header when you scroll down on the page. When you hover over items in the gallery view, they items become shaded and a button appears over them, letting the user know that they are click-able items.</td>

	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td> Most of the navigation on the portfolio consists of scrolling and using the menu bar. Each page has a header on the top and allows you to scroll down in order to reveal more content. The menu bar can be used to navigate to all the main pages of the sites and the logo of the company can be used to click back to the "home" page.

		<span>Minimalistic</span> - The images and text on this portfolio are all very minimalistic. The icons are made up of only outlines and they site doesn't have more than 3-4 different colors on a page.  <br><br>
		<span>Modern</span> - The design and choice of images are all very "futuristic". The portfolio embraces the idea that less is more, and that by withholding content and detail, you can please the user. 
	</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td> The functionality of this site is derived from the lack of content. By using limited amount of images, text, and color, Scoail.li is able to convey their minimalistic brand very clearly. The site also tries to avoid showing too much content and thus withholds the menu bar. The user has to click the menu button in order for the menu bar to show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td>The site has interactive parallax scrolling which is used on multiple pages, this gives the user less of a static scrolling experience. The animation that is triggered when a use presses the menu button also makes the site seem more interactive. The site doesn't have much animation or interactivity, but I think that it is to embody the simplicity of the company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td> The navigation of the site is a bit ambiguous. For starters, the main navigation bar is hidden form the initial rendering of the portfolio and users are required to click on the menu button at least once in order to see the menu. This also means the user cannot see what page he is on from the menu bar without using the menu button. The site does have a lot of scrolling, so it includes a "return to top" button, which makes navigation whole pages a bit easier.</td>

		<span>Artistic</span> - The site full size images and emphasis on a scrapbook communicate to viewers that Luvo is an artist and that this portfolio is designed to primarily showcase his work. <br><br>
		<span>Fun</span> - Animations and page transitions play a big role in demonstrating the fun quality of the site. The animations are very bouncy and active, and his diction is also very relaxed, playful, and maybe even childish. 
	</div>

<tr>
	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td> The site is very functional and works to a high degree. Luvo is able to communicate his brand and his personality on the first page very clearly. He also does a good job of maintaining this communication by keeping a consistent theme throughout the site. The site seems very basic, but he is able to represent his brands by page transitions and structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td>Luvo's portfolio is very interactive and that shows right when the page loads with a progress bar on the top of the page. All his icons and menu bar items have hover effects, as do the project icons on his "Play" page. When viewing one of his projects, the page has interactive scrolling and the user is able to scroll within the screen of the computer (bottom right). The website is also responsive and will adjust to multiple screen sizes.</td>

	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td> Navigation of the site is fairly simple with the menu bar on the left. Since the menu bar is fixed to the side, a user can easily navigate to other parts of the portfolio and can go back to the homepage by pressing on the logo at the top of the navigation bar.

		<span>Simple</span> - Checo Designs is only one page for the entire portfolio, making it very simple and easy to access. The lack of text also gives the page a very simplistic feeling, since the reader doesn't have to exert much effort to take everything in.  <br><br>
		<span>Friendly</span> - The color choice of this page contributes to the friendliness of the site. The website uses soft colors that are easy to start at with the eyes. This gives the portfolio a friendly and welcoming vibe.

	<th>Functionality:</th>
	<td> Since the website is so basic it doesn't have much functionality to it, but is able to communicate it's simplicity and and cleanliness by eliminating clutter and detail. Since the site is bound to one page, the user is able to get through the whole entire portfolio without having to click their mouse. This also adds to the branding of Kelvin's site.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th>Interactivity:</th>
	<td>The lack of content is most likely what contributes to the lack of interactivity. Most of the interactivity on this portfolio comes from the "Projects" section of the portfolio, where the user can use arrows to browse different projects made by Kelvin (bottom right). The menu bar doesn't contain and interactivity as far as hover effects and neither does the rest of the site. The footer contains minor hover effects, but you have to wait til you get to the bottom of the page to see t. This makes the page itself a bit boring. </td>

	<th>Navigation:</th>
	<td>A user can navigate this portfolio by either scrolling or using the menu bar. The page contains anchors that are linked to the menu bar since there is really only one page on this portfolio.
